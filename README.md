## Work Experience

### ThatMate (June 2021 - September 2023)

- We harnessed the power of React.js with TypeScript for an incredibly robust frontend experience, while our rock-solid backend was crafted with Node.js and Express. 
  For crafting fantastic Android applications, we turned to the magic of React Native.
  Our data was efficiently stored in the dynamic duo of MongoDB and PostgresDB.
- Worked on Thatmate official Android app using React Native, to add new features to already existing app.
- Worked as head of development for developing and maintaining web-based applications used by students in India and the USA.
   We mainly used React, Apollo graphql & Mantine UI for FrontEnd.
- I owned multiple full features (front-end+backend) of the website(Admin UI) used by the ThatMate content team to upload content to Android and web applications.
